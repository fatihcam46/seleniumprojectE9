- The reason we have created different packages, and different utility classes, different type of file (.properties) are
    - re-usability
    - to organize our code
    - less code
    - efficient
    - easy to maintain
    - to centralize
    - avoid hard coding


#1- configuration.properties : to centralize and avoid hard coding some of the important test data
#2- TestBase: we can centralize and re-use setup/teardown methods, some important variables and objects etc.
#3- ConfigurationReader : to be able to repeatedly and easily read from our configuration.properties file
#4- Driver : to be able to instantiate our object in less line of code and also be able to steadily pass the same driver instance around in our project
#5- BrowserUtils : to centralize and easy to re-use some of the general utility methods
    - utility methods that are not specific to one page and can be applied in different pages
